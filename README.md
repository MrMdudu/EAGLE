# EAGLE

Eagle files of a SSTC (Solid state tesla coil) project

Schematic from http://www.loneoceans.com/labs/sstc2/
Where you can learn a lot about Tesla coils

Board layout made by myself and not yet tested.

Edit: PCBs were assembled and they work as intended :)

This is my first try at PCD design and there are certainly a lot of flaws so feel free to bring them to my attention.
